# 🎵 YouTube Mood-Based Music Video Downloader

This project is a Python-based tool designed to download music videos from YouTube based on user-defined **moods** (e.g., happy, sad, relaxing). It integrates the **YouTube Data API** for video search and **yt-dlp** for downloading, and it compares performance across **sequential**, **multithreading (ThreadPoolExecutor)**, and **multiprocessing** methods. It is designed for experimentation on **Google Colab** using CPU, GPU, or TPU environments.
